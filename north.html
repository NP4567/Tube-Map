<p> The iconic north London venue offers everything you need for an extraordinary event or great day out with the benefit of some of the best panoramic views of London. There are lots of fun things, such as an ice rink, a skate park, Go-Ape and a boating lake. However, the main attraction is the wide array of organised events held at the palace.
