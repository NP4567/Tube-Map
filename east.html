Not only torture, prisoners or weapons where held there but also exotic animals. Some of these animals included the lions of King John, a polar bear, an eliphant and three leopards of Henry |||.
	You will be guided thorugh the catle by a costume dressed Yeoman Warders. As the tower attracts a lot of people daily you should be there a bit earlier than the masses to get a good look at the Crown Jewels.
